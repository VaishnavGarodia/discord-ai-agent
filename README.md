# CS 153 - Stylist Bot for UGC Creators

Bot Description:

Our Discord bot allows users to submit an Instagram post URL showcasing their outfit. It analyzes the image using the Gemini API to provide a style score and retrieves the postâ€™s engagement metrics (likes and comments). Based on these factors, the bot sends a personalized discount code via direct message, rewarding users for their fashion sense and social media influence.

Use Case:

This bot caters to fashion enthusiasts and influencers seeking feedback on their outfits and incentives for high engagement. By integrating fashion analysis with personalized rewards, it enhances user engagement and fosters brand loyalty within the fashion community. Another use case is it helps them scout UGC creators, and it also allows the brand to set trends which the audience can submit their posts to rate.
