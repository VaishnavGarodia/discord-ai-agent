        "description": "Silly fits are a playful, maximalist fashion trend characterized by unexpected color combinations, clashing prints, and an abundance of whimsical accessories.  Signature pieces include oversized clothing, novelty items, and anything that defies conventional taste, resulting in a deliberately absurd and humorous aesthetic.  The overall effect is one of joyous self-expression and a rejection of seriousness.\n",
